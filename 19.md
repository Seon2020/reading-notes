# Classes, Objects, Pytest, and Thinking Recursively

## Classes and Objects
- "Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects."
- Example of creating a new object (myobjectx) using the MyClass class:
```
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()
```
- ^ myobjectx can now access the variables and functions from the class that was used to create it (MyClass). 
- Example:
  1. We have a class defined for vehicles. Create two new vehicles called car1 and car2. Set car1 to be a red convertible worth $60,000.00 with a name of Fer, and car2 to be a blue van named Jump worth $10,000.00.
```
# define the Vehicle class
class Vehicle:
    name = ""
    kind = "car"
    color = ""
    value = 100.00
    def description(self):
        desc_str = "%s is a %s %s worth $%.2f." % (self.name, self.color, self.kind, self.value)
        return desc_str

# your code goes here
car1 = Vehicle()
car1.name = "Fer"
car1.color = "red"
car1.kind = "convertible"
car1.value = 60000.00

car2 = Vehicle()
car2.name = "Jump"
car2.color = "blue"
car2.kind = "van"
car2.value = 10000.00

# test code
print(car1.description())
print(car2.description())
```

# Game of Greed 2

## Python Scope

## Donâ€™t be CONFUSED by BIG O notation anymore!
Big O Time: Basically how long it takes an algorithm to do things. 
Big O Space: ^How much memory that algorithm takes while doing it.
Why is it necessary? It is a good way to compare algorithms and determine performance/efficiency. 
Big O is also useful for measuring how an algorithm will respond to an increasing amount of data it has to process.

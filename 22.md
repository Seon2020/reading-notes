# Game of Greed 2

## Python Scope

## Donâ€™t be CONFUSED by BIG O notation anymore!
- Big O Time: Basically how long it takes an algorithm to do things. 
- Big O Space: ^How much memory that algorithm takes while doing it.
- Why is it necessary? It is a good way to compare algorithms and determine performance/efficiency. 
- Big O is also useful for measuring how an algorithm will respond to an increasing amount of data it has to process. 
- Big O notation will always give you the worst scenerio. 
- O(1): Constant running time
- O(log n): Logarithmic running time 
- O(n): Linear running time 
- O(n logn): Log-linear running time
- O(n^k): Polynominal running time. 
- O(c^n): Exponential running time.

## How to use Random Module
- Random module allows you to generate random numbers. 
Random functions/methods:
1. Randint(): Generates a random integer by taking in a lowest and a highest number. Example:
```
import random
print random.randint(0, 5)
```
2. Random(): Generates a random number between 0 and 1. Example:
```
# Generates a random number between 0 and 100
import random
random.random() * 100
```
3. Choice(): Generates a random value from a sequence/list. Examples:
```
random.choice( ['red', 'black', 'green'] ).

---

myList = [2, 109, False, 10, "Lorem", 482, "Ipsum"]
random.choice(myList)
```
4. Shuffle(): Shuffles elements in the list, putting them in a different order. Example:
```
import random

mylist = [[i] for i in range(10)]
random.shuffle(mylist)
print(mylist)

Output:
# [[9], [2], [7], [0], [4], [5], [3], [1], [8], [6]]
# Output will very each time
```
5. Randrange(): Generates a random element from a range(start, stop, step). Example:
```
import random
# This will generate 3 random numbers between 0 and 101 with a step of 5. This is depending on the starting number. 
for i in range(3):
    print(random.randrange(0, 101, 5))
# Would output random numbers like 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, etc...

# This will generate 5 random numbers between 1 and 20 with a step of 2. 
for i in range(5):
    print(random.randrange(1, 20, 2))
# Would output random numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7 (hence never output 20).
```
Full on example:
```
import random
import itertools

# This example simulates flipping a coin 10,000 times to count how many times it comes up heads and how many times tails.

outcomes = {
    'heads': 0,
    'tails': 0,
}
sides = list(outcomes.keys())

for i in range(10000):
    outcomes[random.choice(sides)] += 1

print('Heads:', outcomes['heads'])
print('Tails:', outcomes['tails'])

# The results are tabulated in a dictionary using the outcome names as keys: 
Heads: 5091
Tails: 4909
```

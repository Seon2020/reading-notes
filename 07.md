## How I explained REST to my brother  

- Roy Fielding helped write the first web servers. 
- Can think of http as "GPS coordinates for knowledge and information."
- The web is built on "an architectural style called â€œREST".
- APIs: concept is machines using the web just like us. 
- On the web, a "redirect" is like when someone asks you for something and you tell them to get it from someone else. 
- "polymorphism" is a way of saying "different nouns can have the same verb applied to them." 
- http is all about applying verbs to nouns.

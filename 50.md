## Ethics in the Workplace

**The code I'm still ashamed of:**
```
As someone who suffers from severe depression, this one really stuck out to me. This story is an example of how a developer, who was new in the tech world, wrote unethical code that resulted in some people committing suicide. The quiz that the author developed always had the same result: a recommendation to take a certain drug. He know it ws wrong an unethical, yet did it anyway. I do not agree with what he did, but I do not put the blame on him. This is because he has realized his mistake and is a stronger *ethical* human being because of it. This is a great example to be mindful of whether or not the work you are doing is ethical.

## Ethics in Technology 

**Self Driving Car Ethics:** 
```
This article talked about the question of what happens when a pre-programmed car finds itself in a situation where lives are put in danger regardless of the action taken. Sure, self-driving cars can help save tons of lives in the long-run, but are there situations where the car will end up taking lives no matter what decision it makes? This is closely related to the Trolly problem where there is no right answer. Yes, technological advancements are generally a good thing, but I don't think they are all ethnical. I think self-driving cars can be mostly ethnical, but there will undoubtedly be situations that raise ethnical issues and concerns.

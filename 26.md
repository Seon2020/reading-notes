# Data Analysis

## What is Jupyter Lab
- JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.  


**About the video:**
- Gave a great introduction for what JupyterLab can do and what it supports.
- For example, you can execute live markdown and Python code. 

## Numpy Tutorial
- NumPy is a commonly used Python data analysis package.
- Data in ssv (semicolon separated values) format:
```
"fixed acidity";"volatile acidity";"citric acid";"residual sugar";"chlorides";"free sulfur dioxide";"total sulfur dioxide";"density";"pH";"sulphates";"alcohol";"quality"
7.4;0.7;0;1.9;0.076;11;34;0.9978;3.51;0.56;9.4;5
7.8;0.88;0;2.6;0.098;25;67;0.9968;3.2;0.68;9.8;5
```
- find the average quality of the wines:
```
qualities =
[float(item[-1]) for item in wines[1:]]
sum(qualities) / len(qualities)
5.6360225140712945
```
- The above code is doing:
  1. Extract the last element from each row after the header row.
  2. Convert each extracted element to a float.
  3. Assign all the extracted elements to the list qualities.
  4. Divide the sum of all the elements in qualities by the total number of elements in qualities to the get the mean.
-  A 2-dimensional array is also known as a matrix. 
- In a NumPy array, the number of dimensions is called the rank, and each dimension is called an axis. 
- We can create a NumPy array using the numpy.array function.
- One of the limitations of NumPy is that all the elements in an array have to be of the same type
- In the below example: Import the numpy package, pass the list of lists wines into the array function (converting it into a NumPy array), exclude the header row with list slicing, specify the keyword argument dtype to make sure each element is converted to a float:
```
import csv
with open("winequality-red.csv", 'r') as f:
    wines = list(csv.reader(f, delimiter=";"))
import numpy as np
wines = np.array(wines[1:], dtype=np.float)
```
- We can check the number of rows and columns in our data using the shape property of NumPy arrays:
```
wines.shape
(1599, 12)
```

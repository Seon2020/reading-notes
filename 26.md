# Data Analysis

## What is Jupyter Lab
- JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.  


**About the video:**
- Gave a great introduction for what JupyterLab can do and what it supports.
- For example, you can execute live markdown and Python code. 

## Numpy Tutorial
- NumPy is a commonly used Python data analysis package.
- Data in ssv (semicolon separated values) format:
```
"fixed acidity";"volatile acidity";"citric acid";"residual sugar";"chlorides";"free sulfur dioxide";"total sulfur dioxide";"density";"pH";"sulphates";"alcohol";"quality"
7.4;0.7;0;1.9;0.076;11;34;0.9978;3.51;0.56;9.4;5
7.8;0.88;0;2.6;0.098;25;67;0.9968;3.2;0.68;9.8;5
```
- find the average quality of the wines:
```
qualities =
[float(item[-1]) for item in wines[1:]]
sum(qualities) / len(qualities)
5.6360225140712945
```
- The above code is doing:
  1. Extract the last element from each row after the header row.
  2. Convert each extracted element to a float.
  3. Assign all the extracted elements to the list qualities.
  4. Divide the sum of all the elements in qualities by the total number of elements in qualities to the get the mean.

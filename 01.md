#SMACSS and Responsive Web Design#
###Reading Notes 01###

##Shay Howe’s intro to RWD##
**Overview**
-Responsive Web Design is the industy's response to the drastic increase in mobile internet usage. 
-RWD is designing web pages for a divser array of devices and screen sizes.
-Term was conined by Ethan Marcotte. He discusses it in his book [Responsive Web Design](https://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design)
-It is ideal to use responsive and adaptive design together to create the best functioning website.
-Mobile design exists strickly for mobile sites but has drawbacks:
 -Dependencies on new code base
 -Browser sniffing
-RWD has the benefits of all 3 design techniques and is therefore the most popular.

Responsive Web Design is broken down into 3 components: 
1. Flexible Layouts 
2. Media Queries 
3. Flexible Media

**Flexible Layouts**
-Using a flexible grid, the web page can resize to any width. 
-Built using relative length units (commonly ems or percentages).
-Avoid fixed measurements (like px).
-New CSS3 Relative Length Units: vw, vh, vmin, and vmax (new, but growing)
-vw: viewport width
-vh: viewport height
-vmin: viewport minimum (height and width)
-vmax: viewport maximum (height and width)
**Ethan's formula for identifying flexible layout proportions (relative values):
> target ÷ context = result 
-The above formula takes target width of element and divides it by the width of the parent. 

**Flexible Grid Example:**
```CSS
section,
aside {
  margin: 1.858736059%; /*  10px ÷ 538px = .018587361 */
}
section {
  float: left;
  width: 63.197026%;    /* 340px ÷ 538px = .63197026 */   
}
aside {
  float: right;
  width: 29.3680297%;  /* 158px ÷ 538px = .293680297 */
}
```
-With the above css code, the section and aside element's widths are scaled proportionally (relative to the parent).

**Medita Queries Example:**
```
/* @media Rule */
@media all and (max-width: 1024px) {...}

/* @import Rule */
@import url(styles.css) all and (max-width: 1024px) {...}
```
-Each query includes a media type with 1+ expressions.
-Media type examples: all, screen, print, tv, and braille.
-Screen is the default media type.
-Styles are only applied if features allocate to true. 

**Logical Operators in Media Queries**
-And, not, and only.
**And Example:**
```
@media all and (min-width: 800px) and (max-width: 1024px) {...}
```
-And operator allows multiple conditions to be met.

**Not Example:**
```
@media not screen and (color) {...}
```
-Negates the query (all but the one specified in the rule).

**Only Example:**
```
@media only screen and (orientation: portrait) {...}
```
-Selects only the specified rule.

**Media query browser support:***
-Not compatible with internet Explorer 8 and below.

**Mobile First** 
-This involves designing the page for mobile devices first, then using media queries to add style when the viewport it expanded. 

**mobile first media queries breakout example:**
```
/* Default styles first then media queries */
@media screen and (min-width: 400px)  {...}
@media screen and (min-width: 600px)  {...}
@media screen and (min-width: 1000px) {...}
@media screen and (min-width: 1400px) {...}
```
**Mobile first demo:**
```
section,
aside {
  margin: 1.858736059%;
}
@media all and (min-width: 420px) {
  .container {
    max-width: 538px;
  }
  section {
    float: left;
    width: 63.197026%;
  }
  aside {
    float: right;
    width: 29.3680297%;
  }
}
```
-This example mobile first example adds media queries to adjust for viewports greater than 420 pixels wide. 

**Viewport**
-Viewport meta tag invented by Apple.
-Can be used with height/width to inherit device's default height/width. 

**Properties to control how websites are scaled on mobile devices**
-minimum-scale/maximum-scale: min and max that the viewport is scaled. 
-initial-scale: 1-10 (1 is regular zoom)
-user-scalable: Set "no" to disable. This is considered bad practice.

**CSS Viewport Rule***
-To keep style separated from content, it is recommended to use the @viewport css rule.

**Example:**
```
@viewport {
  width: device-width;
  zoom: 1;
}
```
-The above rule is recommended because it helps to keep the page's structure and style separate. 
-Note that support is not yet great for this rule. 

**Flexible Media**
-It is important that media adapts to the size of the viewport. 

**Example:**
```
img, video, canvas {
  max-width: 100%;
}
```
-The above css rule ensures that media scales down to the width of the viewport. 

**Flexible Embedded Media**
-Max-width property can be ineffective for media like iframes and embedded media. 

**Example:**
```
figure {
  height: 0;
  padding-bottom: 56.25%; /* 16:9 */
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
}
iframe {
  height: 100%;
  left: 0;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  width: 100%;
}
```
-The above example showsthe embedded element absolutely positioned with parent. 
-Parent element has a width of 100% to be scalable to viewport.
-Padding for the bottom of the parent element is calculated using the responsive design formula 

##All About Floats##

**Overview**
-Float is a CSS property to position elements. 
-An example is wrapping text around an image. 
-Floated elements are included in the overall flow of the page.
-Very different from absolute positioning (where it is removed from page flow).

**Example of using float:**
```
#sidebar {
  float: right;			
}
```
**4 valid values:**
-Left/Right: Floats elements in either direction.
-None: This is the default and makes the element not float.
-Inherit: This will take the float value from the parent of the element. 

**Note that Flexbox and Grid are now considered stronger options for controlling layout, but float is stll used.**

**Clearing the Float**
-Clearing the float allows an element to stay below/out of the way of other floated elements. 
-4 values:
 -Both: Out of the way of both floated elements.
 -Left/right: Out of the way of only one of the floated elements.
 -None: Default value and is typically unnecessary. 

**Example:**
```
#footer {
  clear: both;			
}
```
-This example shows the clear property set to both so that the footer stays out of the way of floated elements above. 

**Float Collapse**
-If a parent element contains only floated elements, it may collapse to nothing. 
-Collapsing needs to be addressed to avoid strange layout behavior. 
-This is resolved by clearing float after floated elements inside the container, but before the container's close. 

**Techniques for Clearing Floats:**
-Empty DIV method:
```
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
```
-The Overflow Method: Set the overflow CSS property on parent (auto or hidden).
-Easy Clearing Method: Use CSS pseudo selector (:after) to clear floats. Example:
```
.clearfix:after { 
   content: "."; 
   visibility: hidden; 
   display: block; 
   height: 0; 
   clear: both;
}
```

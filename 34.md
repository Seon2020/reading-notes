## How Django Works Behind the Scenes

- Open sources packages like Django require some degree of funding. There are generally three ways that this happens:
  1. Corporate Sponsor: A group of engineers for a for-profit company are paid in part to upkeep the open source code. 
  2. Solo: The code is maintained/managed by a single developer. Funding sources can vary (examples are add-on or consulting services).
  3. Non-profit: This was actually Django's approach early on.
- Django Software Foundation does many things to maintain the service.
- Fellows Program: Largest DSF expense where paid contractors who triage tickets. This is necessary to keep Django on track.

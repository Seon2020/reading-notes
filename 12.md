## EJS Partials
- Partials are useful when you want to utilize the same HTML for multiple views. 
- Including a partial in EJS: 
```
<%- include( PARTIAL_FILE ) %>
```
- ^ Where the partial file is relative to the template you use it in.
- Note: The <%- %> tags allow us to output the unescaped content onto the page (notice the -). This is important when using the include() statement since you don’t want EJS to escape your HTML characters like ‘<’, ‘>’, etc…

## Intro to EJS Partials

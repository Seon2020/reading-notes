# Node, Express, and APIs

# What Is Node and When Should I Use It?

**What is Node.js?**
- Node.js can be defined as "a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine" or "an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library."

**Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine**
- Described as the "the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers." 
- Node programs are not executed in a browser, but instead the creator enhanced the v8 engine with various features like:
  - file system API
  - HTTP library
  - various operating system-related utility methods 
- Put simply, it is a program that can be used to execute JavaScript on our computers (JavaScript runtime). 

**Node Binaries vs Version Manager**
- Recommoneded to use version manager instead as it allows you to "install multiple versions of Node and switch between them at will."
- Using version manager also "negates potential permission issues when using Node with npm and lets you set a Node version on a per-project basis."

**Node.js Has Excellent Support for Modern JavaScript**
- Great support for ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and beyond. 
- Can use the latest JS syntax in code. 
- Don't really have to deal with compatibility issues. See example below:

```
function upcase(strings, ...values) {
  return values.map(name => name[0].toUpperCase() + name.slice(1))
    .join(' ') + strings[2];
}

const person = {
  first: 'brendan',
  last: 'eich',
  age: 56,
  position: 'CEO of Brave Software',
};

const { first, last } = person;
const emoticon = [ ['┌', '('], ['˘', '⌣'], ['˘', ')', 'ʃ'] ];

console.log(
  upcase`${first} ${last} is the creator of JavaScript! ` + emoticon.flat().join('')
);
```

- The above example shows use of modern features like template literals, object destructuring and Array.prototype.flatMap():. The output will display properly when run in the terminal. 

**Introducing npm, the JavaScript Package Manager**
- npm is a package manager for JS and the world’s largest software registry (1,000,000+ packages of JS code are available to download).
- npm install -g jshint will install jshint package globally on your system (we can use it to lint files). 

**Installing a Package Locally**
- We can install a package locally to a project (instead of globally).
- Command npm init -y will create and auto-populate a package.json file located in the same folder.
- Command npm install lodash --save will install lodash package and save it as a project dependency.

**Working with the package.json File**
- npm has saved lodash and any libraries that lodash depends on in a folder called "node_modules".
- This folder can "be re-created at any time by running npm install from within the project’s root."

**What Is Node.js Used For?**
- First common use of Node and npm: "installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application."
- These build tools come in many different shapes and sizes. 
- Used for anything "from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking."
- Build tools can be used for many things such as "bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets," "running tests," and even "automatic code linting and style checking."

**The Node.js Execution Model**
- Node.js is single-threaded and is even-driven, meaning that everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event. 
- Node uses the libuv library to implement asynchronous (non-blocking) behavior.
- Node’s execution model results in little overhead, and is capable of handling many simultaneous connections.

**Are There Any Downsides?**
- Node running on a single thread poses some limitations such as "blocking I/O calls should be avoided, CPU-intensive operations should be handed off to a worker thread, and errors should always be handled correctly for fear of crashing the entire process."

**Hello World Server Example:**
```
const http = require('http');

http.createServer((request, response) => {
  response.writeHead(200);
  response.end('Hello, World!');
}).listen(3000);

console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
```

**Advantages of Node.js**
- Speed and scalability
- Using JavaScript on a web server (and browser)
- No longer need to switch modes (you can code all in the same language)
- Speaks JSON.

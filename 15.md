# DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
  
## Silicon Valley’s gender gap is the result of computer-game marketing 20 years ago
- 70% of tech employees in Silicon Valley are male. 
- "The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that employment of computer and information-technology occupations will grow by 12% between 2014 and 2024, faster than the average for any other occupation."
- Really old computer games 20 years ago were aimed towards males, sparking a larger interest for males to major in computer science. 
- Moreover, many other companies marketed their technology for men over women. 
- "It’s no coincidence that the console touted to have saved the industry was called a “Game Boy.”"  

## Employee breakdown of key technology companies
- Two key takeaways from the chart:
  1. High-profile tech companies tend to have many more male employees compared to female.
  2. White men are the make up the largest portion of tech employees at these high-profile tech companies. 

## Why diversity matters to your tech company 
- Company leaders can be very effective in diversity efforts with their commitments.
- Diverse companies tend to perform better that homogeneous ones. 
- Racial diversity is linked to better financial outcomes.
- Putting a focus on racial diversity, aside from statistics, is just the right thing to do.

# Django REST Framework & Docker

## Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Docker
- Docker: wat to isolate and run applications.
- The entire environment is isolated. 
- No longer need virtual environemtns. 
- Docker is really just linux containers. 
- Downside to virtual machine: size and speed.
- Virtual environments are used to isolate Python software packages locally.
- Virtual environments are more limited compared to Docker containers.
- Check versions of Docker and Docker Compose:
```
$ docker --version
Docker version 19.03.5, build 633a0ea
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.24.1, build 4667896b
```
- use docker info to inspect.
- Only running containers will appear with docker container ls
- Images and containers are the two fundamental concepts to grasp when you start with Docker.
  - image: snapshot in time of what a project contains. 
  - container: running instance of the image.
- Create custom images using a Dockerfile and use docker-compose.yml to run containers. 
- Baking analogy for images and containers concepts:
```
A Dockerfile is the recipe for a cake
An image is a snapshot of the recipe at a given time
A docker-compose.yml says how to make the cake
And the container is the actual, baked cake
```
- Dockerfile: a list of all requirements needed to build our image. 
- Dockerfiles are read from top-to-bottom. 
- Command to build image: docker image build .
- When a change is made to a step, all steps following it will be executed from scratch.
- It is better to put code that will not change at the top and code that will change towards the end.

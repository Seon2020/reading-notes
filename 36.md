# Django CRUD and Forms


## Django Forms

- Forms: a group of one or more fields/widgets on a web page, which can be used to collect information from users for submission to a server.
- Django takes a lot of the work out of creating forms. 
- Example of a simple HTML form:
```
<form action="/team_name_url/" method="post">
    <label for="team_name">Enter name: </label>
    <input id="team_name" type="text" name="name_field" value="Default name for team.">
    <input type="submit" value="OK">
</form>
```
- action: The resource/URL where data is to be sent for processing when the form is submitted.
- POST should be used when the data results in some kind of change to the server's database (this helps protect against cross-site forgery request attacks. 
- GET should be used for things like searches, or things that do not result in a change to the database. 
- Form class: simplifies both generation of form HTML and data cleaning/validation.

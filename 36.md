# Django CRUD and Forms


## Django Forms

- Forms: a group of one or more fields/widgets on a web page, which can be used to collect information from users for submission to a server.
- Django takes a lot of the work out of creating forms. 
- Example of a simple HTML form:
```
<form action="/team_name_url/" method="post">
    <label for="team_name">Enter name: </label>
    <input id="team_name" type="text" name="name_field" value="Default name for team.">
    <input type="submit" value="OK">
</form>
```
- action: The resource/URL where data is to be sent for processing when the form is submitted.
- POST should be used when the data results in some kind of change to the server's database (this helps protect against cross-site forgery request attacks. 
- GET should be used for things like searches, or things that do not result in a change to the database. 
- Form class: simplifies both generation of form HTML and data cleaning/validation.
- Very basic Django form example:
```
from django import forms

class RenewBookForm(forms.Form):
    renewal_date = forms.DateField(help_text="Enter a date between now and 4 weeks (default 3).")
```
- Common arguments to most fields:
```
REQUIRED: If True, the field may not be left blank or given a None value. Fields are required by default, so you would set required=False to allow blank values in the form.
LABEL: The label to use when rendering the field in HTML. If a label is not specified, Django will create one from the field name by capitalizing the first letter and replacing underscores with spaces (e.g. Renewal date).
LABEL_SUFFIX: By default, a colon is displayed after the label (e.g. Renewal date:). This argument allows you to specify a different suffix containing other character(s).
INITIAL: The initial value for the field when the form is displayed.
WIDGET: The display widget to use.
HELP_TEXT: Additional text that can be displayed in forms to explain how to use the field.
ERROR_MESSAGES: A list of error messages for the field. You can override these with your own messages if needed.
VALIDATORS: A list of functions that will be called on the field when it is validated.
LOCALIZE: Enables the localization of form data input (see link for more information).
DISABLED: The field is displayed but its value cannot be edited if this is True. The default is

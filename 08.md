# SQL

# Introduction
- SQL: Structured Query Language
- Allows users to query, manipulate, and transform data from a database.
- A relational database "represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables." 
- Relational database tables are similar to excel spreadsheets. 

# Select Queries 101
- Select statements are referred to as queries. Examples:  
```
Select query for a specific columns
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable;
```
```
Select query for all columns
SELECT * 
FROM mytable;
```

# Queries With constraints (Pt. 1 and 2)
- WHERE clause: filter results being returned. Example"
```
Select query with constraints
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition
    AND/OR another_condition
    AND/OR …;
 ```
 - You can use AND OR logical keywords for the conditions.
 - Conditions allow faster processing time.

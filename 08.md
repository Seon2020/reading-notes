# SQL

## Introduction
- SQL: Structured Query Language
- Allows users to query, manipulate, and transform data from a database.
- A relational database "represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables." 
- Relational database tables are similar to excel spreadsheets. 

## Select Queries 101
- Select statements are referred to as queries. Examples:  
```
Select query for a specific columns
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable;
```
```
Select query for all columns
SELECT * 
FROM mytable;
```

## Queries With constraints (Pt. 1 and 2)
- WHERE clause: filter results being returned. Example"
```
Select query with constraints
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition
    AND/OR another_condition
    AND/OR …;
 ```
 - You can use AND OR logical keywords for the conditions.
 - Conditions allow faster processing time. 

## Filtering and Sorting Query Results
- Distinct keyword allows us to discard rows with duplicate column values. Example: 
``` 
SELECT DISTINCT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s);
```  
- ORDER BY clause allows us to sort results by a given column in ascending or descending order:
```
Select query with ordered results
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY column ASC/DESC;
```
- LIMIT and OFFSET clauses: commonly used with ORDER BY to indicate the subset of results you want. Example: 
```
Select query with limited rows
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY column ASC/DESC
LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;
```
- LIMIT will reduce the number of rows to return.
- The optional OFFSET will specify where to begin counting the number rows from.

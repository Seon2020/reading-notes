# Graphs

- graph: non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of nodes potentially connected by line segments named edges.
- Some common terms:
  - Vertex: also called a “node”, this is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices (or nodes). 
  - Edge: a connection between two nodes.
  - Neighbor: a node next to another, separated by an edge. 
  - Degree: number of edges connected to that vertex.
- Undirected graph: Each edge does not have a specific direction. There are no “directions” given to point to specific vertices.
- Directed graph: Each edge has a specific direction that it point to.

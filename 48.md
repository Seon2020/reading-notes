- Steps to statically generate pages with dynamic routes (page at path called /posts/<id> where <id> can be dynamic):
1. create a page at /pages/posts/[id].js - page must contain:
  1. A React component to render this page.
  2. getStaticPaths which returns an array of possible values for id.
  3. getStaticProps which fetches necessary data for the post with id.

### Whiteboard Advice
- Communication throughout is key! 
- Make sure to restate the question so you prove to yourself and the interviewer that you know the problem domain. 
- Example of restating the fizzbuzz question:
```
“So I’d like to restate the problem to you to make sure I understand what you’re looking for. The sole parameter for my function will be an integer. The sole output of my function will be an incrementing array, starting from the number 1 and ending at the input number.

If a number is a multiple of 3, the output will instead be `fizz`. If a number is a multiple of 5, the output will instead be `buzz`. However, if the output is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the output will instead be `fizzbuzz`. Is my understanding correct?”
```
- Make sure to ask about edge cases
- By stating edge cases, it shows you will be good at preventing bugs.
- Example of asking about edge cases:
```
“Now that I confirmed my understanding of the problem, I’d like to ask about some potential edge cases. Is it possible that the input would be a type other than a number? If so, what should the function do? Can the input be 0 or negative? Again, if so, what should the function do?”
```
- Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass.
- Write pseudo code and check your logic.

# THE CALL STACK

## The Call Stack defined on MDN
- call stack: "mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc."
- Process:
  1. When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.
  2. Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
  3. When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.
  4. If the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a "stack overflow" error.

**Example:**  
```
function greeting() {
   // [1] Some codes here
   sayHi();
   // [2] Some codes here
}
function sayHi() {
   return "Hi!";
}

// Invoke the `greeting` function
greeting();

// [3] Some codes here
```
**Breaking Down the Example:**
1. Ignore all functions until it reaches greeting() function invocation.
2. Add the greeting() function to the call stack list.
```
Call stack list:
- greeting
```
3. Execute all lines of code inside the greeting() function. 
4. Get to the sayHi() function invocation. 
5. Add sayHi() function to the call stack list:
```
Call stack list:
- sayHi
- greeting
```
6. Execute all lines of code inside the sayHi() function, until reaches its end. 
7. Return execution to the line that invoked sayHi() and continue executing the rest of the greeting() function.
8. Delete the sayHi() function from our call stack list.
```
Call stack list:
- greeting
```
9. When everything inside greeting() has been executed, return to its invoking line to continue executing the rest of the JS code. 
10. Delete the greeting() function from the call stack list.
```
Call stack list:
EMPTY
```

## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack

- The Javascript Engine is a "single-threaded interpreter comprising of a heap and a single call stack."  
- Call stack is "a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle."
- Call stack:
    1. It is single-threaded. Meaning it can only do one thing at a time.
    2. Code execution is synchronous.
    3. A function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory.
    4. It works as a LIFO — Last In, First Out data structure.

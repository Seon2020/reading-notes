# MUSTACHE and FLEXBOX

## Templating with Mustache 

**JavaScript Templating**
- Fast/efficient way to redner client-side view templates with JavaScript using JSON data source. 
- Template consists of HTML markup and added templating tags (which will insert variables or run programming logic).
- Replaces variables/instances with actual values (at runtime, converting template to an HTML file sent to client. 

**Mustache**
- Mustache is a template syntax that is logic-less. 
- Used for HTML, configuration files, source code, etc...
- Works by expanding tags in template with values (given in a hash or object). 
- It is "logic-less" because it only includes tags (that are replaced with either values or nothing). 
- mustache.js is the mustache template system being implemented in JavaScript. 
- Considered base for JS templating. 
- No separate templating system on server side. 
- See example below:

```
Mustache.render("Hello, {{name}}", { name: "Sherlynn" });
// returns "Hello, Sherlynn"
```

- The above example, the two braces around name indicate that is is a placeholder (in Mustache syntax).
- The example looks for the 'name' property in the object that was passed in, replacing it with actual value.
- Mustache is NOT a templating engine. It is a specification for a templating language.
- Templates are written according to Mustache specification.
- Template can then be organized by templating engine to be rendered/produce an output.

```
$ yarn add mustache-express

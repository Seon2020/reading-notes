# MUSTACHE and FLEXBOX

## Templating with Mustache 

**JavaScript Templating**
- Fast/efficient way to redner client-side view templates with JavaScript using JSON data source. 
- Template consists of HTML markup and added templating tags (which will insert variables or run programming logic).
- Replaces variables/instances with actual values (at runtime, converting template to an HTML file sent to client. 

**Mustache**
- Mustache is a template syntax that is logic-less. 
- Used for HTML, configuration files, source code, etc...
- Works by expanding tags in template with values (given in a hash or object). 
- It is "logic-less" because it only includes tags (that are replaced with either values or nothing). 
- mustache.js is the mustache template system being implemented in JavaScript. 
- Considered base for JS templating. 
- No separate templating system on server side. 
- See example below:

```
Mustache.render("Hello, {{name}}", { name: "Sherlynn" });
// returns "Hello, Sherlynn"
```

- The above example, the two braces around name indicate that is is a placeholder (in Mustache syntax).
- The example looks for the 'name' property in the object that was passed in, replacing it with actual value.
- Mustache is NOT a templating engine. It is a specification for a templating language.
- Templates are written according to Mustache specification.
- Template can then be organized by templating engine to be rendered/produce an output. 

**Mustache-Express**
- mustache-express allows you to use mustache w/ Node and Express.
- To install with Yarn:

```
$ yarn add mustache-express
```

- To install with NPM: 

```
$ npm install mustache --save
```

## A Guide to Flexbox

**Basics**
- Some properties are meants for the parent element (flex container) and some the children (flex items).
- Items are laid out following the main axis (primary axis) or cross axis (perpendicular to main). 
- Main size: flex item's width or height (depending on the main dimension).

**Properties for Children (Flex Items)**
- order: controls order that they appear in container (source order is default).
- flex-grow: defines ability for item to grow (unitless value). 
- flex-shrink: defines ability for item to shrink if needed. 
- flex-basis: defines default size of element before remaining space is distributed. 
- flex: shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis (in that order). Last two are optional. 
- align-self: Allows default alignment to be trumped for individual items. 

**Properties for Parents (Flex Container)**

- display: defines a container (inline or block). Enables flex content for all direct children. 
- flex direction: Determines the main-axis to define the direction items are placed in the container. 
- Flexbox is a "single-direction layout concept". It primarily consists of horizontal or vertical columns. Values:
  1. row (default): left to right (ltr) or right to left (rtl).
  2. row reverse: right to left (ltr) or left to right (rtl). 
  3. column: same as row but top to bottom
  4. column-reverse: same as row-reverse but bottom to top. 
- flex wrap: Flex items, by default, try to fit on one line, so this property changes that to wrap. Values:
  1. nowrap: (default) all items on one line.
  2. wrap: items wrap on multiple lines (top to bot).
  3. wrap-reverse: items wrap on multiple lines from bot to top. 
- flex flow: shorthand for flex-direction and wrap (which together define containers main + cross axes). Default value: row nowrap. 
- justify-content: defines alignments along main axis. Helps distribute extra space. Values:
  1. flex-start: (default) items packes near start of flex-direction. 
  2. flex-end: items packed towards end of direction. 
  3. start: items packed toward start of writing-mode direction.
  4. end: items packed toward end of writing-mode direction.
  5. left: items packed towards left edge of container (behaves like start when it does not match up with flex-dir.
  6. right: items packed towards right edge of container (behaves like start when it does not match up with flex-dir.
  7. center: items centered on line.
  8. space-between: items distributed evenly.
  9. space-around: items distributed evenly w/ equal space around. 
  10. space-evenly: items distributed evenly (and evenly with container).
  11. safe or unsafe: safe ensures items cannot be pushed off-screen. 
- align-itmes: defines behavior for items being laid along cross axis (like justify-content for cross-axis). Vals:
  1. stretch: (default) stretch to fill container.
  2. flex-start/start/self-start: items places at start of cross axis. 
  3. flex-end/end/self-end: items placed at end of cross axis. 
  4. center: items centered in cross axis. 
  5. baseline: items aligned so baselines align. 
  6. safe/unsafe: Can be used in conjunction with values above to help prevent aligning elements off-screen. 
- align-content: aligns container's lines within (when there is extra space in cross-axis). This is like how justify-conten aligns items within main axis. This property is invalid when you only have one line of items. Values:
  1. normal: (default) items packed in default position (like if no value was set).
  2. flex-start/start: items packed to start of container. Flex-start honors flex-direction and start writing-mode.
  3. flex-end/end: items packed to start of container. Flex-start honors flex-direction and end writing-mode.
  4. center: items centered in container.
  5. space-between: items distributed evenly in container.
  6. space-around: items distributed evenly with equal space around each line. 
  7. space-evenly: items distributed evenly with equal space around them. 
  8. stretch: lines stretch to consume remaining space. 
  9. safe/unsafe: Can be used with values above. Prevents items from going off-screen.

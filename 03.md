# MUSTACHE and FLEXBOX

## Templating with Mustache 

**JavaScript Templating**
- Fast/efficient way to redner client-side view templates with JavaScript using JSON data source. 
- Template consists of HTML markup and added templating tags (which will insert variables or run programming logic).
- Replaces variables/instances with actual values (at runtime, converting template to an HTML file sent to client. 

**Mustache**
- Mustache is a template syntax that is logic-less. 
- Used for HTML, configuration files, source code, etc...
- Works by expanding tags in template with values (given in a hash or object). 
- It is "logic-less" because it only includes tags (that are replaced with either values or nothing). 
- mustache.js is the mustache template system being implemented in JavaScript. 
- Considered base for JS templating. 
- No separate templating system on server side. 
- See example below:

```
Mustache.render("Hello, {{name}}", { name: "Sherlynn" });
// returns "Hello, Sherlynn"
```

- The above example, the two braces around name indicate that is is a placeholder (in Mustache syntax).
- The example looks for the 'name' property in the object that was passed in, replacing it with actual value.
- Mustache is NOT a templating engine. It is a specification for a templating language.
- Templates are written according to Mustache specification.
- Template can then be organized by templating engine to be rendered/produce an output. 

**Mustache-Express**
- mustache-express allows you to use mustache w/ Node and Express.
- To install with Yarn:

```
$ yarn add mustache-express
```

- To install with NPM: 

```
$ npm install mustache --save
```

## A Guide to Flexbox

**Basics**
- Some properties are meants for the parent element (flex container) and some the children (flex items).
- Items are laid out following the main axis (primary axis) or cross axis (perpendicular to main). 
- Main size: flex item's width or height (depending on the main dimension).

**Properties for Children (Flex Items)**
- order: controls order that they appear in container (source order is default).
- flex-grow: defines ability for item to grow (unitless value). 
- flex-shrink: defines ability for item to shrink if needed. 
- flex-basis: defines default size of element before remaining space is distributed. 
- flex: shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis (in that order). Last two are optional. 
- align-self: Allows default alignment to be trumped for individual items.

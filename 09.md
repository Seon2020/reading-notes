## Functional Programming Concepts
- John Outerhout: “Complexity is anything that makes software hard to understand or to modify." 
- Wikipedia: "Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data"

**Pure Function**
- Definition of purity in a function: 
  1. It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic).
  2. It does not cause any observable side effects.
- Example of impure function:
```
let PI = 3.14;

const calculateArea = (radius) => radius * radius * PI;

calculateArea(10); // returns 314.0
```
- The above is impure because it uses a global object (pi) that was not passed as a parameter. 
- Below, the function is made pure: 
```
let PI = 3.14;

const calculateArea = (radius, pi) => radius * radius * pi;

calculateArea(10, PI); // returns 314.0
```
- If our function reads external files, it’s not a pure function — the file’s contents can change.
- Any function that relies on a random number generator cannot be pure.
- Examples of observable side effects: modifying a global object or a parameter passed by reference.
- Mutability is discouraged in functional programming.

# Refactoring

## Functional Programming Concepts
- John Outerhout: “Complexity is anything that makes software hard to understand or to modify." 
- Wikipedia: "Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data"

**Pure Function**
- Definition of purity in a function: 
  1. It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic).
  2. It does not cause any observable side effects.
- Example of impure function:
```
let PI = 3.14;

const calculateArea = (radius) => radius * radius * PI;

calculateArea(10); // returns 314.0
```
- The above is impure because it uses a global object (pi) that was not passed as a parameter. 
- Below, the function is made pure: 
```
let PI = 3.14;

const calculateArea = (radius, pi) => radius * radius * pi;

calculateArea(10, PI); // returns 314.0
```
- If our function reads external files, it’s not a pure function — the file’s contents can change.
- Any function that relies on a random number generator cannot be pure.
- Examples of observable side effects: modifying a global object or a parameter passed by reference.
- Mutability is discouraged in functional programming.

**Referential transparency**
- "Basically, if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent."
```
pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency
```

**Functions as First Class Entities**
- The idea of functions as first-class entities is that functions are also treated as values and used as data.
- Functions as first-class entities can:
  1. refer to it from constants and variables
  2. pass it as a parameter to other functions
  3. return it as result from other functions
- The idea is to treat functions as values and pass functions like data. This way we can combine different functions to create new functions with new behavior.

**Higher-order Functions**
- Higher-order function is one that either: takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result.

**Reduce**
- The idea of reduce is to receive a function and a collection, and return a value created by combining the items.

**Filter**
- "The filter function expects a true or false value to determine if the element should or should not be included in the result."
- True will include and false will exclude.

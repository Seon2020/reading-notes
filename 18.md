# FileIO & Exceptions

## Read & Write Files in Python
- File: contiguous set of bytes used to store data.
- Files are composed of three main parts:
  1. Header: metadata about the contents of the file (file name, size, type, and so on)
  2. Data: contents of the file as written by the creator or editor
  3. End of file (EOF): special character that indicates the end of the file
File paths are broken into three major parts:
  1. Folder Path: the file folder location on the file system where subsequent folders are separated by a forward slash / (Unix) or backslash \ (Windows)
  2. File Name: the actual name of the file
  3. Extension: the end of the file path pre-pended with a period (.) used to indicate the file type
- Encoding: translation from byte data to human readable characters.
- ASCII and Unicode share the same numerical to character values. 
- Use open() to open a file before working with it. It's argument is the path to the file. 
- ALWAYS make sure an open file is properly closed. 
- Example of closing a file using the try-finally block:
```
reader = open('dog_breeds.txt')
try:
    # Further file processing goes here
finally:
    reader.close()
```
- Example of closing a file using the with statement:
```
with open('dog_breeds.txt') as reader:
    # Further file processing goes here
```
- ^ with statement automatically takes care of closing the file once it leaves the with block, even in cases of error.
- ^^ after the file name in the with statement, you can add a mode argument (such as 'r' which specieis that the file should be in read-only mode (this is default). 
- [click here for the full list of other mode options](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open)
- A file object is "an object exposing a file-oriented API (with methods such as read() or write()) to an underlying resource."
- Three different categories of file objects:
  1. Text files
  2. Buffed binary files
  3. Raw binary files
- Read methods:
  1. .read(size=-1): reads from the file based on the number of size bytes. If no argument is passed or None or -1 is passed, then the entire file is read.
  2. .readline(size=-1): reads at most size number of characters from the line. This continues to the end of the line and then wraps back around. If no argument is passed or None or -1 is passed, then the entire line (or rest of the line) is read.
  3. .readlines(): This reads the remaining lines from the file object and returns them as a list.
- You can use list() as well to create a list out of the file object.

## Pain and Suffering  
- Anticipate feeling the pain of growth in an accelerated learning environment. Specifically, I will anticipate:
  1. Being pushed mentally
  2. Forging my path towards a solution
  3. Hours of research
  4. Being pushed emotionally
  5. Collaborating with new people
  6. Being pushed outside my comfort zone
  7. Dealing with uncertainty
  8. Being pushed physically 
  9. Losing sleep
- Remember, all growth comes with some degree of pain. 
- Pain can be good in the service of growth. 
- Understand the difference between pain and suffering. 
- Consider the story you attach to working through feeling the pain of growth:
  1. Whatâ€™s your perspective?
  2. Why are you doing this?
  3. Do you want what comes at the end of this journey?
  4. Are you doing this for you?
  

## Beginners Guide to Big O
- Big O notation: Describes the performance or complexity of an algorithm. 
- O(1): describes an algorithm that will always execut in the same time or space. Example:
```
bool IsFirstElementNull(IList<string> elements)
{
    return elements[0] == null;
}
```
- O(N): describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. Example:
```
bool ContainsValue(IList<string> elements, string value)
{
    foreach (var element in elements)
    {
        if (element == value) return true;
    }

    return false;
}
```
- O(N2): represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. Example:
```
bool ContainsDuplicates(IList<string> elements)
{
    for (var outer = 0; outer < elements.Count; outer++)
    {
        for (var inner = 0; inner < elements.Count; inner++)
        {
            // Don't compare with self
            if (outer == inner) continue;

            if (elements[outer] == elements[inner]) return true;
        }
    }

    return false;
}
```
- Deeper nested iterations will result in O(N3), O(N4) etc.
- O(2N): denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set. Example: 
```
int Fibonacci(int number)
{
    if (number <= 1) return number;

    return Fibonacci(number - 2) + Fibonacci(number - 1);
}
```
- Logarithms (O(log N)): The iterative halving of data sets, producing a growth curve that peaks at the start and slowly flattens out.

# Trees

**Common Terminology:**  
- node: individual item/data that makes up the data structure
- Root: The root is the first/top Node in the tree
- Left Child: The node that is positioned to the left of a root or node
- Right Child: The node that is positioned to the right of a root or node
- Edge: The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
- Leaf: A leaf is a node that does not contain any children
- Height: The height of a tree is determined by the number of edges from the root to the bottommost node  

**Traversals:**  
- Depth first:  prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first. Three methods:
  1. Pre-order: root >> left >> right
  2. In-order: left >> root >> right
  3. Post-order: left >> right >> root

- The most common way to traverse through a tree is to use recursion.

- pre-order traversal:
```
ALGORITHM preOrder(root)

  OUTPUT <-- root.value

  if root.left is not NULL
      preOrder(root.left)

  if root.right is not NULL
      preOrder(root.right)
```
- Pre-order means that the root has to be looked at first. 
- In-order:
```
ALGORITHM inOrder(root)
// INPUT <-- root node
// OUTPUT <-- in-order output of tree node's values

    if root.left is not NULL
        inOrder(root.left)

    OUTPUT <-- root.value

    if root.right is not NULL
        inOrder(root.right)
```
- Post order:
```
ALGORITHM postOrder(root)
// INPUT <-- root node
// OUTPUT <-- post-order output of tree node's values

    if root.left is not NULL
        postOrder(root.left)

    if root.right is not NULL
        postOrder(root.right)

    OUTPUT <-- root.value
```

# Trees

**Common Terminology:**  
- node: individual item/data that makes up the data structure
- Root: The root is the first/top Node in the tree
- Left Child: The node that is positioned to the left of a root or node
- Right Child: The node that is positioned to the right of a root or node
- Edge: The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
- Leaf: A leaf is a node that does not contain any children
- Height: The height of a tree is determined by the number of edges from the root to the bottommost node  

**Traversals:**  
- Depth first:  prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first. Three methods:
  1. Pre-order: root >> left >> right
  2. In-order: left >> root >> right
  3. Post-order: left >> right >> root

- The most common way to traverse through a tree is to use recursion.

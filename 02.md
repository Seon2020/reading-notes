# jQuery, Events, and The DOM

**What is JQuery?**
- JQuery offers an easy way to perform many JavaScript tasks easily.
- Support is across all browsers (no fallback code needed).
- JQuery is a file that you can include in your web pages (it is like a library).
- Select elements using CSS-style selectors (see example below).

```
$('li.hot')
```
- The above example selects all 'li' elements with a class name of hot.

**How do you do something with your selection?**
- To do something with your selection, you can attach various method to it (see example below).

```
$('li.hot').addClass('complete');
```

- The above code selects all 'li' elements with a class name of hot and adds a class of complete.

**How do you include the JQuery script?**
- You include the script just before the closing body tag (just like other scripts).
- You can download the script from http://jquery.org.
- Note that the file will still end with ".js" as it is a JavaScript library.
- Some files may end in "min.js" with signifies that the file has undergone "minification".
- Minification is where unnecessary spaces, comments, and carriage returns are removed from the original code.

**Why use JQuery?**
- You may achieve the same things with normal JavaScript, but JQuery simplifies the process (see list of main reasons below).
1. Simple Selectors: CSS-style selectors are more simple than traditional DOM selectors.
2. Less Code, Same Task: Code is more condensed, allowing for less code that does the same thing.
3. Browser Compatibility: JQuery solves the browser compatibility issues (no more fallback code).

**Get/Set Data**
- If your selection includes more than one element, the JQuery object refers to all of then with index numbers (starting at 0).
- If you get data from your selection, it will only get it from the first element in the selection.
- If you set data for your selection, it will do it for all of them.
- With selections, it does NOT create a copy of them. Instead, it stores a reference to the element(s) in the DOM tree.

**Looping**
- There is no need to write a loop because the same action will be done on each element in a selection (see example below).

```
$('li.hot').addClass('favorite');
```

-In the code above, the class of favorite will be added to every 'li' element with a class name of hot.

**Chaining** 
- You can chain together multiple methods to be applied to the same selection of elements (see example bekow).

```
$('li[id!="one"]').hide().delay(500).fadeIn(1400);
```

-In the code above, the hide, delay, and fadeIn methods are all applied to every element in the selection. 

**The .ready() method**
- This method makes sure the page is ready before applying the subsequent function
- More specifically, it makes sure the DOM content has loaded (not waiting for other page assets, like images). 
- See the below example for the traditional syntax.

```
$(document).ready(function() {
  //Script goes here
});
```

- Please see below for the more common shorthand version.

```
$(function() {
  //Your script goes here
});
```

**Getting Content**
- .html() method allows you to get the html data from the first element in your set (and its descendants).
- .text() method allows you to get the text only from the ALL elements in your matched set.

**Setting Content**
- .html() method gives every element in the matched set the new data (replacing the old).
- .text() method gives every element in the matched set the new text content (replacing the old). 
- .replaceWith() method replaces each element in the set with the new content (can include html) and returns the replaced elements.
- .remove() method removes all elements in the matched set. 

**Inserting Elements and Content**
- .before() method allows you to insert content before the selected element(s).
- .after() method allows you to insert content after the selected element(s). 
- .prepend() method allows you to insert content just after the openeing tag of the selected element(s).
- .append() method allows you to insert content just before the closing tag of the selected element(s).

**Example:**

```
$(function() {
  $('ul').before('<p>Hello</p>');
  $('li').prepend('+');
});
```

- The above example shows a 'p' element with the text "hello" being added before an unordered list. It also shows a "+" being added before each list item. 

**Getting and Setting Attribute Values**
- .attr() method allows you to get or set an attribute and its value: .attr('attribute name', 'attribute value');
- .removeAttr() method allows you to remove an attribute (along with its value).
- .addClass() method allows you add a new class value to the selected elements (does not overwrite).
- .removeClass() method allows you to remove a specified class value (does not affect the other class values for that element).

**Getting and Setting CSS Properties**
- The below example shows how to get a CSS property (storing it in a variable):

```
var backgroundColor = $('li').css('background-color'); 
```

- The above example gets the value of the background color (as an RGB value) for ONLY the first list item.
- The below example shows how to set a CSS property:
 
 ```
 $('li').css('background-color', '#272727');
 ```
 
 - The above example sets the background color for ALL list items to #272727. 
 - When dealing with pixels, you can add (+=) or subtract (-=) from the current value.
 - When setting multiple properties, you use **object literal syntax** (example below). 
 
 ```
 $('li').css({
    'background-color': '#272727',
    'font-family': 'Courier'
 });
 ```
 
 **Working With Each Element in a Selection**
- The .each() method allows you to perform 1+ statements to the same set of elements (like a loop).
- You can use the "this" keyword to refer to the current element.
- Note that $(this) uses the this keyword to create a new JQuery selection (containing the current element). This allows you to use multiple methods on that element. 
- See an example of the above points below. 

```
$(function() {
  $('li').each(function() {
    var ids = this.id;
    $(this).append(' <span class="order">' + ids + '</span>');
  });
});
```

- The above example shows the following:
1. the .each() method being applied to every 'li' element.
2. "this.id" gets the value of the id attribute for each 'li'. 
3. The id value is added to the end of each list item. 

**Events**
- .on() method is used to handle all events. See below to see where to enter the parameters.

```
$('selection').on('event', function() {
  //Statement(s) go here
});
```

- JQuery has many events to choose from, such as 'click', 'focus', and 'keydown'. 
- Do not include "on" before the event name you choose. 

**Event Object**
- Each event receives an event object by default. 
- The event object has its own properties and methods. See the example below.

```
$('li').on('click', function(e) {
  eventType = e.type
});
```

- In the example, "e" is selected as parameter name for the event object. 
- "e.type" is used to obtain the type of event that occured (type is a property of the event object). 

**Additional Parameters for Event Handlers**

- The .on() method has 2 optional parameters (selector and data). See the example below. 

```
.on('event'[, selector][, data], function(e));
```

- The selector parameter allows you to include a subset of the elements in your initial selection. 
- The data parameter allows you to pass extra info to the function that is called. 

**Ways to Include JQuery in Your Page**
- You can use a version of JQuery that is hosted by other companies (examples are JQuery CDN, Google, and Microsoft). 
- A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a collection of servers spread around the globe, serving static files quickly. 

**Where to Place Your Scripts**
- Avoid putting it in the head because the page will appear slower, processing the script before the DOM content. 
- Putting the script just before the closing body tag is the best location because the DOM content will load first, creating a better user experience.

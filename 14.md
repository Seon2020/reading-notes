# DATABASE NORMALIZATION

**Introduction to Database Normalization**
- Database Normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.
- Each table should be about a specific topic. 
- By limiting a table to one purpose you reduce the number of duplicate data contained within your database.

**Reasons for Database Normalization**
- Three main reasons to normalize a database:
  1. Minimize duplicate data
  2. Minimize or avoid data modification issues
  3. Simplify queries

**Data Duplication and Modification Anomalies**
- Duplicate data presents two problems:
  1. It increases storage and decrease performance.
  2. It becomes more difficult to maintain data changes
- There are 3 modification anomolies:
  1. Insert anomaly: When we cannot record facts until we have data for the entire row. 
  2. Update anomaly: When we have the same data in multiple rows, they all need to be updated when there is a change. This makes the table prone to inconsistencies.
  3. Deletion anonmaly: When a row removal causes removal of more than one set of facts. 

**Search and Sort Issues** 
- When you, for example, have three columns for customer names, your query might look like this:
```
SELECT SalesOffice
FROM SalesStaff
WHERE Customer1 = ‘Ford’ OR
      Customer2 = ‘Ford’ OR
      Customer3 = ‘Ford’
```
- As you can see, the above query is long for just searching one customer. 

**Definition of Database Normalization**
- Three common forms of database normalization: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd normal form (abbreviated as 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF). 
- 1NF: The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.
- 2NF: The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.
- 3NF: The table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key.
- These forms are progessive, so you must satify one to quality for the other.

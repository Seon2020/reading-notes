# SENDING FORM DATA

## Sending Form Data 

**Client/server architecture**
- "a client (usually a web browser) sends a request to a server (most of the time a web server like Apache, Nginx, IIS, Tomcat, etc.), using the HTTP protocol. The server answers the request using the same protocol."
- "An HTML form on a web page is nothing more than a convenient user-friendly way to configure an HTTP request to send data to a server."

**On the client side: defining how to send the data**
- "The <form> element defines how the data will be sent. The two most important attributes are action and method."
- action attribute: defines where the data gets sent.
  1. value must be valid relative or absolute url.
  2. If not speccified, default is the page that the form exists on. Example:
```
<form action="https://example.com">
```
- method attribute: defines how data is sent. most common methods are get and post. 
- Let's look at how HTTP works: "Each time you want to reach a resource on the Web, the browser sends a request to a URL. An HTTP request consists of two parts: a header that contains a set of global metadata about the browser's capabilities, and a body that can contain information necessary for the server to process the specific request."
- get: method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource: "Hey server, I want to get this resource." In this case, the browser sends an empty body. Because the body is empty, if a form is sent using this method the data sent to the server is appended to the URL.
- Example of HTTP get request:
```
GET /?say=Hi&to=Mom HTTP/2.0
Host: foo.com
```
- post: method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request: "Hey server, take a look at this data and send me back an appropriate result."
- Example of HTTP post request (notice that the data is included in the body this time instead of the url):
```
POST / HTTP/2.0
Host: foo.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 13

say=Hi&to=Mom
```

# SENDING FORM DATA

## Sending Form Data 

**Client/server architecture**
- "a client (usually a web browser) sends a request to a server (most of the time a web server like Apache, Nginx, IIS, Tomcat, etc.), using the HTTP protocol. The server answers the request using the same protocol."
- "An HTML form on a web page is nothing more than a convenient user-friendly way to configure an HTTP request to send data to a server."

**On the client side: defining how to send the data**
- "The <form> element defines how the data will be sent. The two most important attributes are action and method."
- action attribute: defines where the data gets sent.
  1. value must be valid relative or absolute url.
  2. If not speccified, default is the page that the form exists on. Example:
```
<form action="https://example.com">
```
- method attribute: defines how data is sent. most common methods are get and post. 
- Let's look at how HTTP works: "Each time you want to reach a resource on the Web, the browser sends a request to a URL. An HTTP request consists of two parts: a header that contains a set of global metadata about the browser's capabilities, and a body that can contain information necessary for the server to process the specific request."
- get: method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource: "Hey server, I want to get this resource." In this case, the browser sends an empty body. Because the body is empty, if a form is sent using this method the data sent to the server is appended to the URL.
- Example of HTTP get request:
```
GET /?say=Hi&to=Mom HTTP/2.0
Host: foo.com
```
- post: method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request: "Hey server, take a look at this data and send me back an appropriate result."
- Example of HTTP post request (notice that the data is included in the body this time instead of the url):
```
POST / HTTP/2.0
Host: foo.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 13

say=Hi&to=Mom
```  

**Viewing HTTP requests**
- These requests are never displayed to the user. 

**On the server side: retrieving the data**
- Whichever HTTP method you choose, the server receives a string that will be parsed in order to get the data as a list of key/value pairs.

**A special case: sending files**
- Sending files with HTML forms is a special case because it is binary data (as opposed to text data).
- enctype attribute: lets you specify the value of the Content-Type HTTP header included in the request generated when the form is submitted.
- The 3 extra steps to send files: 
  1. Set the method attribute to POST because file content can't be put inside URL parameters.
  2. Set the value of enctype to multipart/form-data because the data will be split into multiple parts, one for each file plus one for the text data included in the form body (if text is also entered into the form).
  3. Include one or more <input type="file"> controls to allow your users to select the file(s) that will be uploaded. Example:
```
<form method="post" action="https://www.foo.com" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <div>
    <label for="file">Choose a file</label>
    <input type="file" id="file" name="myFile">
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Send the file</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

# Hash Tables

### Intro to Hash Tables
- Hash: Result of an algorithm taking a string and then converting it into a value that could be usef for a purpose. In context of hashtables, it is used to determine the index of the array. 
- Buckets: The contents of each index in the array of the hashtable. Basically, each index is a bucket.
- Collisions: When multiple keys get hashed to the same location (index) in the hashtable. 
- Uses:
  1. Hold unique values
  2. Dictionary
  3. Library
- Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs.
- Retrieving value in hashtable is O(1) time complexity.
- Example:
```
["Greenwood:98103", "Downtown:98101", "Alki Beach:98116", "Bainbridge Island:98110", ...]
```
- Hash maps take advantage of an array's O(1) read access. 
- hash map uses a “hash function” to place each item at a precise index location, based off it’s key.
- Hash function takes a key and returns an integer.
- hash code is calculated in constant time and writing to an array at one index is O(1) so the hash map has O(1) access.

### what is a hash table?
- Key and value pairs
- Array structure
- Hash tables are typically very larger
- Hash(key) -> index (returns index)
- You can chain multiple key value pairs at the same index. 
- If collision, just chain off of that index number. 
- Hash codes should NOT have randomness to them!
- Example:
```
Key = "Cat"
Value = "Josie"
# Add or multiply all the ASCII values together.
67 + 97 + 116 = 280
# Multiply it by a prime number such as 599.
280 * 599 = 69648
# Use modulo to get the remainder of the result, when divided by the total size of the array.
69648 % 1024 = 16

Key gets placed in index of 16. 
```
